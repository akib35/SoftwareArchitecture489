Elastic computing is the ability of quick change of computing (processing, memory, storage, networking) resources in changing demands with automation that resolves planning and engineering for peak useage. It is managed by system monitoring tools, elastic computing ensures that the allocated resources match the actual needs without causing operational disruptions. Cloud elasticity allows companies to avoid costs associated with unused capacity or idle resources and eliminates the need for investing in additional resources and equipment maintenance.

Despite concerns about security and limited control, elastic cloud computing offers numerous advantages. It is more efficient than traditional IT infrastructure, typically automated to reduce reliance on human administrators, and ensures continuous service availability by preventing unnecessary slowdowns or interruptions.
