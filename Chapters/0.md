# Introduction
This chapter illustrates the starting of the core views, principles, and concepts of software architecture.

# Description
Lets say we have a small scale company called sundarban express that provides goods through online shopping. The company has a small scale software that manages the inventory, customer information, and order processing.

However, the software has client server model as architecture. For example,

![Figure](../Figures/0.client-server-model.png)
on software architecture pov, 
- user confirms order and want to make payment
- vendor server provides a link with bank acc number
- user uses this link and makes payment in bank server 
- vendor server confirms from bank as well as user 
Here the sever compares the confirmation of transaction from user and bank server, hence ensure integrity. Now an international company with business in large scale wants to buyout the software. 

**What could be the possible issues regarding software(specifically architecture)**

# Issues
- Integration of different data structures
- currency conversion
- big scale companies uses their own payment gateway and controls in their own server, so the whole redirection and tocken generation process won't be compitable.
